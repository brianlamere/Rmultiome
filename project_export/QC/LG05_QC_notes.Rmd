## Trimming notes

Hard 1D trim settings:
max_nCount_ATAC = 40000
max_nCount_RNA = 25000
min_nCount_ATAC = 1000
min_nCount_RNA = 200
max_nss = 1.5
min_nss = 0.4
max_percentMT = 8

LG05 has an interesting set of plots, there is a second, likely biologically
important peak in a couple density plots.

## PC1
PC1 in the merged object is being skipped for neighbors and harmony, because it
appears to be technical data due to strong negative correlation with RNA; further
checks would just reinforce the idea, not reduce it, so just these three were done.

	Pearson's product-moment correlation
