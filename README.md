# Rmultiome
A small tool set that is being designed for 10X multiome data from brain nuclei

Rebased after learning many of the vignettes that seem to apply, don't really
for my particular data set (very high depth, brain nuclei, thus very strong 
batch effects but no need to do things like redoing peaks, etc).
