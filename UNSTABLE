refactoring.  compare the repo from a month ago to the one from EOD today, and then the scaffolding that was added, logically follow the use for it

Have gone through system_settings, run_qc.R, run_pipeline1.R, functions/helper_functions.R

run_pipeline1.R needs additional change to do compare_cellbender_reports(mode="pipeline")
run_pipeline2.R and the postmerge_* functions should not need to be changed at all based on the cellbender addition, since...by then we're past that point

modify functions/premerge_processing_functions.R base_object to check use_cellbender setting, and...use it, if it's TRUE.
This brings in the display/write cb_report distinction as well, not just the calling of import/merge

Add 3 new functions, in functions/premerge_processing_functions.R 

compare_cellbender_reports <- function(mode = c("qc", "pipeline"),
                                       samples = NULL,
                                       report_dir = NULL { ... }

generate_cb_report < function(
# can't find the function signature, but it was intended to create a csv with:
* sample id
* n_atac, n_cb, n_intersection, prop_atac_covered
* pearson, spearman, r2, slope, intercept
* weighted_removed, ratio_median, ratio_q05, ratio_q95
* nnz_ratio

split the below code that was done on console, into function(s) that:
1) read cellranger multiomic h5
2) read cellbender gex h5
3) replace cellranger GEX matrix with cellbender GEX matrix

idea was a read_cellbender_h5 (or whatever name) function, to isolate data source, then
reading cellranger multiomic is already in seurat and simple, then second merge function that
replaces cellranger GEX with cellbender GEX

here was the sloppy code:
> multi <- Read10X_h5("filtered_feature_bc_matrix.h5")
Genome matrix has multiple modalities, returning a list of matrices for this genome
> rna_orig <- multi$`Gene Expression`
> atac_orig <- multi$Peaks
> library(scCustomize)
